# 🌱 AI-Based Waste Classification for Sustainability ♻️

This project aims to build an AI system using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** to classify waste into multiple categories like recyclable, organic, plastic, metal, etc., to support sustainable waste management and smart recycling systems.

### 🏢 Internship
**Shell-Edunet Skills4Future Internship (Oct–Nov 2025)**  
Theme: **Sustainability & AI/ML**

---

### 📌 Problem Statement
Urban waste mismanagement leads to pollution, landfill overflow and resource loss.  
To tackle this, we will build a **CNN-based waste classifier** using image data to automatically identify waste categories and enable smart waste sorting systems.

---

### 🗂 Dataset
- Source: Kaggle — **Garbage Classification Dataset**
- Contains ~10 waste classes (Plastic, Paper, Metal, Glass, Cardboard, Organic, etc.)
- Ideal for CNN classification tasks

Dataset Link will be added during Week-2.
