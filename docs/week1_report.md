### Additional Learning (Week-1)

During Week-1, I studied the following:

- Basics of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- How image classification works
- Understanding dataset structure & labeling
- Teachable Machine workflow for training custom CNN models
- How datasets from Kaggle are used for machine learning projects
- Project planning & GitHub repo setup

Outcome:
I now have a complete understanding of the project goal, dataset, CNN concept, and training plan using Teachable Machine.
